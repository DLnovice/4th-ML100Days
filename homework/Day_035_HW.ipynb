    "Multilabel learning has become a relevant learning paradigm in the past years due to the increasing number\n",
    "of fields where it can be applied and also to the emerging number of techniques that are being developed.\n",
    "This article presents an up-to-date tutorial about multilabel learning that introduces the paradigm and\n",
    "describes the main contributions developed. Evaluation measures, fields of application, trending topics, and\n",
    "resources are also presented.\n",

    "1. INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is one of the main tasks in data mining. Given a set of training patterns\n",
    "consisting of a set of features and an associated class, the aim of classification is to\n",
    "obtain a model that will be able to assign the proper class to an unknown pattern. This\n",
    "formulation of the problem entails the restriction of only one label per pattern; nevertheless, there are increasing numbers of classification problems being contemplated\n",
    "today, such as text and sound categorization, semantic scene classification, medical diagnosis, or gene and protein function classification in which a pattern can have several\n",
    "labels simultaneously associated. For instance, in the field of semantic scene classification, a picture containing a landscape with both a beach and a mountain could\n",
    "be associated with beach and mountain categories simultaneously. This type of problem is called multilabel in comparison with classical supervised learning (also calledsingle-label [Schapire and Singer 2000]). Solving a problem with multilabel data involves new challenges due to the exponential growth of combinations of labels to take\n",
    "into account and also to the computational cost of building and querying the models. In addition, multilabel data usually present features such as high dimensionality,\n",
    "unbalanced data, and dependences between labels.\n",
    "Thus, during the past years, the paradigm of Multilabel Learning (MLL) has arisen\n",
    "as a kind of supervised learning and has become a very hot topic. Despite the publication of some works compiling the basis of MLL [Tsoumakas and Katakis 2007; de\n",
    "Carvalho and Freitas 2009; Tsoumakas et al. 2010a; Zhang and Zhou 2014], it is not\n",
    "possible to find an up-to-date tutorial on MLL. The aim of this article is to cover, among\n",
    "other issues, the formal definition of the problem, the domains where MLL has been\n",
    "applied, an up-to-date summary of the main proposals presented during latest years,\n",
    "evaluation measures, and resources. This article is organized as follows. In Section 2,\n",
    "the MLL problem is formally defined. After that, in Section 3, some aspects related to\n",
    "the development and evaluation of MLL models are described. The main approaches\n",
    "developed in the literature are presented in Section 4. Next, Section 5 describes findings on empirical comparisons between MLL algorithms. Section 6 describes the maindomains where MLL has been applied, and, finally, new trends in MLL (Section 7) and\n",
    "a set of conclusions are presented. The article also includes an Appendix with resources\n",
    "(software, datasets, etc.) for MLL."
